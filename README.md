My plan is to analyze the possible and various Machine Learning Algorithms in Detection of Malware to boost better secure systems. 
By automating the malware analysis system, both expenses and human labor will decrease, as well as the efficiency is believed to increase.

For feature engineering, Label Encoding technique is used.

Currently, different intrustions, namely 'back','satan',  'ipsweep','portsweep', 'warezclient', 'teardrop' are detected. 
Random Forest and Decision Tree produced a satisfactory result in the prediction of above mentioned threats. However, Logistic Regression failed to
appropriately detect those 6 intrusions on network logs.
